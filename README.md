# UDP-File-Transfer
An ATTEMPT at making my own custom "file transfer protocol" using UDP and was made purely just to learn how to use UDP, it would have obviously been much better and simpler if I had just used TCP instead. 

Works okay when used to send files on just a local computer or over a local network, but would rather serve better as a DDOS tool against your own network if attempting to use it to send any decently sized file over the internet. This is probably caused by the program sending too many packets through the internet, overloading the internet bandwith provided by an ISP. Have yet to come back to this project to fix this problem.
